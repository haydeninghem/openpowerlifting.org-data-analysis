## Summary 
In powerlifting, an athlete is judged based on their best 1 rep weight in the squat, bench, and deadlift. You have 3 attempts in each lift to do your best. 
using an open source project called openpowerlifting.org (https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/ for the CSV version) we are able to see the competition results for all major powerlifting organizations in the world. 
This analysis is focused on 3 groups for both men and women:
* USAPL - The most consistiently drug tested powerlifting organization in the united states ( Roughly 10% )
* IPF   - The largest drug tested federation in the world but not nearly as consistient as the USAPL. TL;DR a lot of countries have a 0% drug test rate. Watch this video to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFtKDxXRhHg
* Untested - All of the not drug tested federations have been grouped together. Just because an organization is not drug tested does not mean everyone is taking steroids. There are a lot of international events that this may be there best option.

Many athletes will compete multiple times across many different weight classes and possibly between tested and untested powerlifting orgs.

 I have transformed the data to only look at the best squat, bench, and deadlift attempts made by a particular person per weight class.
 This report documents what a lifter could expect in their career of powerlifting and what percentile that would place them in. 
 Here is an example from the report for 70-80 KG lifters. The SBD weights are in pounds while the weightclasses are in kilos.
